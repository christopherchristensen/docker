### Proxy servers blocking connections to web app once up and running

*Proxy server settings*

Proxy servers can block connections to your web app once it’s up and running. If you are behind a proxy server, add the following lines to your Dockerfile, using the `ENV` command to specify the host and port for your proxy servers:

```
# Set proxy server, replace host:port with values for your servers
ENV http_proxy host:port
ENV https_proxy host:port
```

*DNS settings*

DNS misconfigurations can generate problems with `pip`. You need to set your own DNS server address to make `pip` work properly. You might want to change the DNS settings of the Docker daemon. You can edit (or create) the configuration file at `/etc/docker/daemon.json` with the `dns` key, as following:

```
{
  "dns": ["your_dns_address", "8.8.8.8"]
}
```

In the example above, the first element of the list is the address of your DNS server. The second item is the Google’s DNS which can be used when the first one is not available.

Before proceeding, save `daemon.json` and restart the docker service.

```
sudo service docker restart
```

Once fixed, retry to run the `build` command.
